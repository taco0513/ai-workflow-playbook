# 🚀 AI Workflow Playbook - Progress Tracker

## 📅 Sprint Goals
**Current Sprint**: v4.0.0 - MASTER_PLAYBOOK Knowledge Base Complete
**Duration**: 2025-02-01

### Goals
- [x] Remove PROTOTYPES directory structure
- [x] Update all documentation to reflect MASTER_PLAYBOOK-only approach
- [x] Transform project into pure knowledge base for app builders
- [ ] Create unified app builder interface

## 📊 Feature Status

### Completed Features ✅
1. **Project Restructuring**
   - Removed PROTOTYPES directory (45 files deleted)
   - Updated main documentation files (7 files modified)
   - Transformed to knowledge base architecture

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - README.md: Complete rewrite for knowledge base approach
   - CLAUDE.md: Updated for MASTER_PLAYBOOK usage
   - MASTER_INDEX.md: Restructured as navigation guide
   - All subdirectory READMEs aligned with new structure

### In Progress 🔄
- Unified app builder implementation
- Knowledge base API design

### Planned 📋
- Create single-entry-point app builder
- Implement knowledge base query system
- Add template selection interface

## 📈 Technical Metrics

### Code Changes
- **Files Deleted**: 45 (entire PROTOTYPES structure)
- **Files Modified**: 7 (documentation updates)
- **Lines Changed**: ~2000+ lines

### Documentation Coverage
- **Updated**: 100% of main documentation
- **New Focus**: MASTER_PLAYBOOK as knowledge base
- **Version**: v3.1.1 → v4.0.0

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Major Decision: PROTOTYPES Removal
**Rationale**: 
- Significant feature overlap with MASTER_PLAYBOOK
- MASTER_PLAYBOOK contains more advanced implementations
- Simpler structure with single knowledge base
- Better suited for app builder use case

### New Architecture
```
AI_Workflow_Playbook/
├── MASTER_PLAYBOOK/     # Complete knowledge base (26 modules)
├── documentation/       # User guides
├── management/         # Progress tracking
└── setup/             # Installation
```

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Resolved
- [x] Duplicate functionality between PROTOTYPES and MASTER_PLAYBOOK
- [x] Complex directory structure
- [x] Unclear project purpose

### Current
- [ ] Need unified app builder interface
- [ ] Knowledge base indexing system required
- [ ] Template extraction automation needed

## 📝 Next Session Plan

### Immediate Tasks
1. Design unified app builder interface
2. Create knowledge base query system
3. Implement template extraction from MASTER_PLAYBOOK
4. Add "fun mode" for non-business projects

### Long-term Goals
- Automated app generation from conversation
- Smart template selection based on requirements
- Integration with AI Interview System
- Context Engineering automation
